# Stock-Analysis

## Objective of this project

- The purpose of this project is to help Steve analyze and sort stocks from 2017 and 2018 
- This is to help his parents figure out an easier route to their investments
- This also determines if the code we are using can work well with thousands of stocks, all by refractor/ editing the code to make the code run faster from the VBA script. 

## Results

- In the images above and below:
  - By refractoring the code through VBA Script, the results have sorted through thousands of stocks within less than a second
  - Results in 2017 would have been a great time to make investments in the stocks as the ticker "DQ" would have a 199.4% increase of returns
  - Results in 2018 would have been a terrible time to make investments as the stocks drops including "DQ" with a drop of -62.6% decrease of returns
  - In this case, ENPH and RUN would be a better chose to invest money in 2018.

## Summary
#### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refractoring code?

- Advantages to refractoring the code would be the fact that it sorts the dataset faster and it is more convenient to use
- Disadvantages to refractoring the code would be the fact that it takes alot more time and more addition coding to put in to make it an advantage to work

#### How do these pros and cons apply to refractoring the original VBA script?

- Pros for the original code: 
  - simplier coding
  - less edits in the coding

- Proes for the refractored code:
  - sorts the data faster
  - more convenient to use

- Cons for the original code:
  - it only sorts a few datas
  - though its considered quite fast already but compared to the refractored coding, it is slower by 0.8 miliseconds

- Cons for the refractored code:
  - more of a complex coding
  - more edits/ refractors in the coding
